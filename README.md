FP-Growth Compression and Decompression App

Overview
--------

This project implements a Python-based application for compressing and decompressing transaction data using the FP-Growth algorithm. The FP-Growth algorithm is a widely used method for mining frequent itemsets in a transaction database, offering efficient data compression. The application includes functionalities for both compressing transaction data into frequent patterns and decompressing it back to its original form.

Features
--------

- FP-Growth Algorithm Implementation: Efficiently compresses transaction data by extracting frequent patterns.
- Compression and Decompression: Supports both compression of .dat files and decompression back to the original transactions.
- Compression Ratio Calculation: Calculates the compression ratio based on file size and the number of transactions.
- Modular Design: Clean and modular code structure with separate classes for compression and decompression.
- Unit Testing: Comprehensive test suite to ensure code reliability.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

Setup:

1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fp_growth_compression_app.git
   cd fp_growth_compression_app

2. Install Dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----

1. Compressing Transactions

To compress transaction data from an input .dat file:

   python main.py

This will read the transactions from data/input.dat, compress them using the FP-Growth algorithm, and save the compressed patterns to output/compressed.dat.

2. Decompressing Transactions

To decompress the data back to its original form:

   python main.py

This will read the compressed patterns from output/compressed.dat, decompress them, and save the original transactions to output/decompressed.dat.

3. Calculate Compression Ratio

The application automatically calculates and prints the compression ratio based on both the file size and the number of transactions after compression.

Testing
-------

Run the unit tests using the following command:

   python -m unittest discover tests

This will run the test suite, ensuring that the FP-Growth algorithm, compression, and decompression functionalities are working as expected.

Example
-------

Input File (data/input.dat):

   A B C
   A C
   B C
   A B C D

Compressed Output (output/compressed.dat):

   C A B: 2
   C A: 1
   C B: 1

Decompressed Output (output/decompressed.dat):

   A B C
   A B C
   A C
   B C
