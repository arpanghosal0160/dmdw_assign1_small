Introduction
------------
The FP-Growth Compression App is designed to efficiently compress large transaction datasets. It uses the FP-Growth algorithm to find frequent patterns in the data, which are then used to reduce the dataset's size.

Features
--------
- **Efficient Data Compression**: Compress large transaction datasets using frequent pattern mining.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface for easy usage.
- **Customizable**: Allows setting minimum support thresholds for pattern mining.
- **Scalable**: Can handle large datasets effectively.
